'm Zaid, a passionate Full-Stack MERN Developer currently expanding my skills in Data Science. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, real-world applications and writing clean, logical, and efficient code. With experience in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, along with a growing interest in Python, machine learning, and data analysis, I aim to bridge the gap between development and intelligent data-driven solutions. I’m continuously learning, building, and improving as I work toward becoming a strong developer and future data scientist.
